Stock Trading Simulation
-------------------------
Welcome to the Stock Trading Simulation repository! This project is a simulation of a stock trading platform made in Java. It allows users to trade stocks and track their portfolio in a realistic and interactive environment.

In the latest update, we have added the ability to fetch real-time stock prices using the Alpha Vantage ***RESTful API***.


Features
-------------------------
- Buy and sell stocks
- Track portfolio and performance
- Real-Time stock data powered by the Alpha Vantage API

Getting Started
-------------------------
To run the simulation, you will need to have Java installed on your machine.

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/harabalos/Stocks-Simulation
```

2.  To use the API, you will need to obtain an API key from the Alpha Vantage website [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

2.  To protect your API key, create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Make sure to replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

4. Run the code!

5. Enjoy Trading!
